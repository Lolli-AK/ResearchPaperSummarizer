Defining the Scope & Features:
First, outline the core features: the AI tutor should be able to accept a research paper as input, parse its content, and generate explanations in multiple formats (text, audio, video, graphics).
Decide whether the tool will focus on a few specific types of AI papers (like transformers or reinforcement learning) or if it will be more general.
Choosing the Tech Stack:
For the parsing and natural language processing, she might use Python with libraries like Hugging Face Transformers or spaCy.
For the graphical and video generation, she might consider libraries like Matplotlib for graphics and possibly something like MoviePy for generating simple videos. For audio, she could use a text-to-speech library such as gTTS or something more advanced depending on her needs.
Since you mentioned Replit, she could use it for development and testing. Replit supports Python and has a collaborative environment, which could be very handy.
Building the Parsing Engine:
Start by building a module that can read and parse research papers, most often in PDF format. Libraries like PyPDF2 or PDFplumber can be useful here. Then, use NLP techniques to break down the text into understandable sections, identify key concepts, and summarize them.
Creating Explanation Modules:
Develop modules that generate explanations in different formats. The text-based explanation might use more straightforward NLP summarization. For audio, she can integrate a text-to-speech engine. For video, she could combine the text summary with visual aids (like diagrams) and use a video generation library to stitch them together.
Iterative Testing & Feedback:
As she builds each part, she should test them individually and then together. She could use Replit’s collaborative features to get feedback from peers or mentors.
Deploying on Replit:
Once everything is working well, she can deploy the application on Replit. Replit allows her to host and run the application so she can access it anytime. It’s also easy to share the link with others for demonstration or collaboration.
